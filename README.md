# Multinomial-Naive-Bayes Classifier
Predictions for spam/ham emails using Multinomial naive bayes classifier

This project was created in terms of the course 'Artificial Intelligence' in the 5th semester of Department of Computer Science @AUEB

I have built multinomial naive bayes classifier from scratch without using any libraries like scipy. 
My dataset was enron which you can find from this [site](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/Enron-Spam/readme.txt).
After saving my results to xls files, I made comparisons with many metrics like F1,accuracy,recall,precision and also with another classifier found on Github.

For more information about the results of the project , see Report.doc written in greek.
